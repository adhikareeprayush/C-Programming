# C Programming Project

This repository contains a comprehensive set of resources, code examples, and documentation for learning and practicing C programming. The project is organized into multiple folders, each focusing on a specific topic or concept in C.

## Folder Structure

- **1. Setting Up Environment/**: Guides and programs to help set up your C programming environment.
- **2. Introduction to C Programming/**: Overview, basic input/output, and structure of C programs.
- **3. DataTypes Variables Constants/**: Information and code on data types, variables, and constants in C.
- **4. Operators and Expressions/**: Documentation and examples of different operators and expressions.
- **5. Control Statements/**: Examples and explanations of control statements like loops, conditionals, break, and continue.
- **9. Structures/**: Programs and notes on using structures in C.
- **9. Unions/**: Programs and notes on using unions in C.
- **10. Dynamic Memory Allocation/**: Examples and explanations of malloc, calloc, realloc, and memory management.
- **11.Recursion/**: Programs demonstrating recursion in C.
- **12. FileHandling/**: Examples and documentation on file handling, including binary and text file operations.

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders to find documentation and code examples for each topic.
2. Read the markdown files for explanations and theory.
3. Explore the `Programs/` subfolders for practical code samples.
4. Compile and run the C files using your preferred C compiler (e.g., GCC).

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a C compiler installed (such as GCC or Clang).
- Follow the instructions in `1. Setting Up Environment/` to configure your environment.
- Start with the introductory sections and progress through the topics as needed.
